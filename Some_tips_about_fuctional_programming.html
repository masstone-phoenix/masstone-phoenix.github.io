1.  Combining set! with local variables is the general programming
technique we will use for constructing computational objects with local state.
2.  From the point of view of one part of a complex process, the other
parts appear to change with time. They have hidden time-varying local
state. If we wish to write computer programs whose structure reflects
this decomposition, we make computational objects (such as bank accounts and random-number generators) whose behavior changes with  time.We model *state with local state variables,and we model the changes of state with assignments to those variables.*
3.  A language that supports the concept that “equals can be substituted
for equals” in an expression without changing the value of the expression is said to be referentially transparent.
4.  The environment model of procedure application can be summarized
by two rules:


    *  A procedure object is applied to a set of arguments by constructing
a frame, binding the formal parameters of the procedure to the
arguments of the call, and then evaluating the body of the procedure
in the context of the new environment constructed. The new
frame has as its enclosing environment the environment part of
the procedure object being applied.
    *  A procedure is created by evaluating a λ-expression relative to a
given environment. The resulting procedure object is a pair consisting
of the text of the λ-expression and a pointer to the environment
in which the procedure was created.
    * Evaluating the expression (set! ⟨variable ⟩ ⟨value ⟩) in some environment
locates the binding of the variable in the environment and changes
that binding to indicate the new value. That is, one finds the first frame
in the environment that contains a binding for the variable and modifies
that frame.
